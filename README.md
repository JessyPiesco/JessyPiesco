Hi there, I'm Jessy! 👋

I'm a Colorado native and self-proclaimed geek with a passion for learning and problem-solving. My knack for pattern recognition allows me to excel in expanding my skills in IT and learning C++. 🖥️

•Fun fact: I have a great knack at predicting the "bad guy" in a movie within the first 10 minutes! 🎥

 When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy playing games and sipping on a glass of wine. I'm currently working on Corks (under the repository of Wino's), which lets me pick the best wines. 🍷

•Fun fact: My favorite PS4 game is Horizon Zero Dawn. 🕹️

Let's connect on LinkedIn to stay in touch, and check out my personal website at https://jessypiesco.netlify.app/ to learn more about me and my projects. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Let's chat! 🚀
