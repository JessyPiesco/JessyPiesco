Hi there, I'm Jessy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Colorado native and self-proclaimed geek with a passion for learning and problem-solving. My knack for pattern recognition allows me to excel in my current studies of IT and C++.

â€¢Fun fact about me: I can usually predict the "bad guy" in a movie within the first 10 minutes!

When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy playing games, and sipping on a glass of wine. I'm currently working on Corks, a project with the repository of Wino's, that helps me always choose the best wines.

â€¢Fun fact about me: My favorite PS4 game is Horizon Zero Dawn.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and check out my personal website at https://jessypiesco.netlify.app/ to learn more about me and my projects.

Let's build something great together! ðŸš€
